# Farm-to-Buyer Direct Platform

This project is a digital marketplace designed to connect farmers directly with buyers in Ghana, aiming to solve inefficiencies in the agricultural supply chain. By reducing the role of middlemen, the platform helps lower consumer prices and increase farmer profits. It uses an admin-assisted model to help non-tech-savvy farmers participate in the digital economy.

## Tech Stack

The platform is a modern, decoupled web application built with the following technologies:

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Java 17, Spring Boot | REST API and business logic |
| **Frontend** | TypeScript, Next.js (React) | Responsive user interface |
| **Database**| PostgreSQL | Primary data storage |
| **UI Library**| shadcn/ui | UI components |
| **Authentication**| Spring Security, JWT | Secure access to the API |
| **File Storage** | Cloudinary | Storing produce images |

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK 17 or later
* Maven 3.8+
* Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
* PostgreSQL 16
* A running Cloudinary instance (for image uploads)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd farm-to-buyer-platform
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (`/apps/api`):**

    * Navigate to the `api` directory.
    * Create an `application-local.yml` file and configure your database connection, JWT secret, and default admin credentials.
    * Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
    * The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

3.  **Frontend Setup (`/apps/web`):**

    * Navigate to the `web` directory.
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Create a `.env.local` file and add the API base URL: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080`
    * Run the development server: `npm run dev`
    * The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Documentation

The backend exposes a RESTful API at the `/api/v1` base path.
