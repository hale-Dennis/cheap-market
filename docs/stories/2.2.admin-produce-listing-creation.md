## Story
**As a** System Admin,
**I want** to create a new produce listing on behalf of a farmer,
**so that** their goods can be made available for sale on the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. From the admin dashboard, an admin can initiate a "Create New Listing" workflow.
2. The creation form allows the admin to select a registered farmer from a list.
3. The form allows the admin to assign the listing to a category from the list created in Story 2.1.
4. The form must capture the produce name, a brief description, price, unit of measure (e.g., "per kg," "per bunch"), and the harvest date.
5. The admin must be able to upload at least one image for the produce listing.
6. Upon submission, the new listing is saved and associated with the selected farmer.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Add "Create Listing" page `apps/web/pages/admin/listings/create.tsx` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Build `ListingForm` component with fields: `farmerId` (select), `categoryId` (select), `name`, `description`, `price`, `unit`, `harvestDate`, `images[]` (AC: 2-5)
  - [ ] Fetch farmers via `/api/v1/admin/farmers` and categories via `/api/v1/admin/categories` (AC: 2,3)
  - [ ] Image upload: integrate Cloudinary widget or backend presigned upload (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Client-side validation: required fields, positive price, valid date.
  - [ ] Prevent selecting more than 5 images; enforce JPEG/PNG and ≤2 MB each (edge-case)
- [ ] Backend: Extend data model (`Product`) and migration.
  - [ ] POST `/admin/products` to create listing (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Validate farmer & category IDs exist; price > 0 (AC: 2-4)
  - [ ] Persist images URLs array; support 1-N images.
  - [ ] Reject >5 images or invalid MIME types with 422.
  - [ ] Ensure listing `listingStatus` defaults to `ACTIVE`.
- [ ] Storage: Use Cloudinary upload with folder organized by farmer id.
- [ ] Backend: Secure endpoint with ADMIN role.
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit & service tests for listing creation (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for form validation, image upload mocks (Jest + RTL) (AC: 1-5)
  - [ ] E2E test: Admin completes listing creation workflow (Playwright) (AC: 1-6)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Produce listings are the core marketplace content. Allowing admins to publish listings ensures quality control and accelerates inventory availability.

### Dependencies
- Requires categories from Story 2.1 and farmer data from Story 1.3.
- Authentication/admin dashboard from Story 1.2.

### Data Models
- `Product` model attributes: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `unit`, `harvestDate`, `imageUrls[]`, `listingStatus`, `farmerId`, `categoryId`, timestamps.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#Product Model]

### API Specifications
- Endpoint: `POST /admin/products` to create listing.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/admin/products]

Example request:
```json
{
  "farmerId": "f123",
  "categoryId": "c456",
  "name": "Organic Tomatoes",
  "description": "Fresh organic tomatoes grown without pesticides.",
  "priceCents": 1500,
  "unit": "per kg",
  "harvestDate": "2025-07-01",
  "imageUrls": [
    "https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/tomatoes1.jpg"
  ]
}
```

Successful response (201):
```json
{
  "id": "p789",
  "farmerId": "f123",
  "categoryId": "c456",
  "name": "Organic Tomatoes",
  "priceCents": 1500,
  "unit": "per kg",
  "imageUrls": [ "..." ],
  "listingStatus": "ACTIVE",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-02T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Component Specifications
- `ListingForm` with multi-image upload, selects for farmer/category, numeric price input (currency mask).
- Use shadcn/ui components & React Hook Form + Zod.

### File Locations
- Frontend page: `apps/web/pages/admin/listings/create.tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/admin.ts` `createProduct`.
- Backend: `ProductController.java`, `ProductService.java`, `ProductRepository.java`.
- Cloudinary upload util: `apps/api/src/main/java/com/ftb/api/util/ImageUploader.java`.

### Testing Requirements
- Tests per architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Max 5 images per listing; images must be JPEG/PNG ≤ 2 MB.
- Price stored as integer cents to avoid floating rounding.
- Image URLs stored as array column or linked table.
- Reject more than 5 images with HTTP 422.
- Reject price ≤ 0 with HTTP 422.
- Allow only MIME types `image/jpeg`, `image/png`; invalid types return HTTP 422.

## Testing
- Unit: ProductService validates inputs and persists.
- Component: Form validation, image upload handling.
- E2E: Full create-listing flow with Cloudinary mock.
- CI must show test suites pass; back-end ProductService coverage ≥ 80 %, front-end listing page ≥ 80 %.
- Edge-case tests: price ≤ 0 returns 422; >5 images returns 422; invalid image type returns 422.
- Optional a11y test: form labels/contrast via axe-core.
