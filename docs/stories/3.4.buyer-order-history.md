## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Buyer,
**I want** to view a history of my past and current orders,
**so that** I can track their status.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A logged-in buyer can access an "My Orders" page from their profile.
2. The page lists all their past and present orders, showing at least the order date, total price, and current status.
3. The current status can be one of: "Pending," "Ready for Pickup," "Out for Delivery," "Completed," or "Disputed.".

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Add protected route `apps/web/pages/orders/index.tsx` linked from profile menu (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Fetch orders via `GET /orders` (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Render table/list with columns Date, Total, Status, and link to order detail (future story) (AC: 2,3)
  - [ ] Status badge component with color mapping per status (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Empty state illustration when no orders.
  - [ ] Implement infinite scroll: load next page when user nears bottom; show loading spinner (edge case: >3 pages)
- [ ] Backend: Implement `GET /orders` endpoint for buyer (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Supports pagination & sorting by date desc.
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for OrderService listByBuyer (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for orders list rendering & empty state (Jest + RTL) (AC: 1-3)
  - [ ] E2E test: Buyer with orders sees list; buyer with no orders sees empty state (Playwright) (AC: 1-3)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Order history gives buyers visibility into ongoing and past transactions, improving trust and transparency.

### Dependencies
- Requires order creation from Story 3.3.
- Authentication infrastructure (Epic 1).

### Data Models
- Uses `Order` model fields: `id`, `createdAt`, `finalTotal`, `status`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#Order Model]

### API Specifications
- Endpoint: `GET /orders` (buyer scope) returns paginated list.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/orders]

[Source: docs/prd/epic-3-end-to-end-ordering-fulfillment.md#story-3-4-buyer-order-history]

### Component Specifications
- `OrdersTable` or `OrdersList` component with responsive design.
- Status badge colors: Pending (yellow), Ready for Pickup (blue), Out for Delivery (orange), Completed (green), Disputed (red).

### File Locations
- Frontend page: `apps/web/pages/orders/index.tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/orders.ts` `listOrders`.
- Backend controller: `OrderController.java` `listBuyerOrders` method.

### Testing Requirements
- Follow architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Paginate 10 orders per page with infinite scroll.
- Ensure endpoint secured with JWT buyer role.
- Infinite scroll should prefetch next page to ensure smooth UX; show spinner when loading.

## Testing
- Unit: OrderService returns buyer orders sorted.
- Component: Table renders statuses correctly, empty state.
- E2E: Buyer navigates to orders page and sees list.
- CI must show tests pass; backend OrderService coverage ≥ 80 %, frontend orders page ≥ 80 %.
- Edge-case tests: simulate >30 orders (3+ pages) to verify infinite scroll loads additional pages correctly.
