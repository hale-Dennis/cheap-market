Approved

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to sign up for a buyer account,
**so that** I can track my orders and save my delivery information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A public "Sign Up" page is available.
2. A user can register with their name, email, password, and home region.
3. Upon successful registration, the user is automatically logged in.
4. An authenticated buyer can view a basic profile page where they can manage their delivery details.

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Buyer signup enables demand-side onboarding, letting users place orders and manage deliveries, essential for marketplace functionality.

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 1.1 (project scaffolding), authentication infrastructure from Story 1.2 (JWT handling), and shared region list from previous stories.

### Data Models
- `User` model attributes used: `fullName`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `region`, `deliveryAddress`, `role`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#User Model]

### API Specifications
- `POST /auth/register` for buyer signup.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/auth/register]
  Expected response shape (`GET /buyer/profile`):
  ```json
  {
    "fullName": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "region": "ASHANTI",
    "deliveryAddress": {
      "street": "123 Market Rd",
      "town": "Kumasi",
      "gpsAddress": "AK-123-4567"
    }
  }
  ```
  `PUT /buyer/profile` accepts the same structure and returns the updated buyer object.

[Source: docs/prd/epic-1-platform-foundation-user-management.md#story-1-5-buyer-account-signup-and-profile]

### Component Specifications
- `SignUpForm`, `BuyerProfileForm` React components using shadcn/ui inputs.
- Client-side password confirmation validation.

### File Locations
- Frontend pages: `apps/web/pages/signup.tsx`, `apps/web/pages/buyer/profile.tsx`.
- API client functions: `apps/web/lib/api/auth.ts` `register`, `apps/web/lib/api/buyer.ts` `getProfile` & `updateProfile`.
- Backend controller: `apps/api/src/main/java/com/ftb/api/controller/AuthController.java` (register), `BuyerController.java` for profile.
- Service & repository: utilize existing `UserService` & `UserRepository`.

### Testing Requirements
- Tests co-located in frontend and backend as per architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Passwords stored as BCrypt hashes; enforce minimum 8 chars.  
- JWT expiry 1 hour; stored in secure HttpOnly cookie.  
- Region select options from `packages/shared-types/regions.ts`.  
- Duplicate email registration returns HTTP 409.
- Password must include at least **one uppercase letter** and **one numeral**; backend returns HTTP 422 on weak password.
- Email must match RFC 5322 basic format; invalid email returns HTTP 422.
- Email confirmation workflow is out-of-scope and deferred to a later story.

## Testing
- Unit: Registration validation errors, profile update success.
- Component: SignUpForm validation and submission.
- E2E: Full sign-up and profile update flow passes.
- CI must show test suites pass; backend UserService coverage ≥ 80 percent.
- Frontend: Statement coverage ≥ 80 percent for sign-up & profile pages.
- Edge-case tests: weak password rejected (422), duplicate email returns 409, invalid email format returns 422.
