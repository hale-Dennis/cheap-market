## Story
**As a** Buyer,
**I want** a way to report a problem with a completed order,
**so that** I can resolve issues with quality or accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. On the detail page for a "Completed" order, the buyer has a "Report Issue" button.
2. Clicking the button opens a simple form where the buyer can describe the problem.
3. Upon submission, the order's status is changed to "Disputed," and a notification is sent to the System Admin for review.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: In Order Detail page (future), show `ReportIssueButton` for orders with status `COMPLETED` and not yet disputed (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Clicking opens `DisputeFormModal` with textarea (max 500 chars) (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Submit calls `POST /disputes` endpoint (AC: 2)
  - [ ] On success, UI updates order status to `DISPUTED` and disables button (AC: 3)
- [ ] Backend: Implement `POST /disputes` endpoint (AC: 2-3)
  - [ ] Validate order belongs to buyer and status is `COMPLETED`.
  - [ ] Persist `Dispute` entity and set order status to `DISPUTED` atomically.
  - [ ] Trigger notification entry for System Admin (AC: 3)
- [ ] Notification worker (existing or placeholder) sends email/dashboard alert to admin.
- [ ] Frontend: Update Order History status badge to show `Disputed` (red) (Story 3.4 update).
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for DisputeService create & order status update (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 2-3)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for modal validation, status update (Jest + RTL) (AC: 1-3)
  - [ ] E2E test: Buyer disputes completed order, sees status change, duplicate dispute blocked (Playwright) (AC: 1-3)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Dispute submission provides buyers a recourse mechanism, ensuring platform accountability and quality assurance.
Note: A future admin-focused story will cover the workflow for reviewing and resolving disputes raised through this mechanism.

### Dependencies
- Requires order completion flow from Story 3.3.
- Notification system used in 3.3.

### Data Models
- `Dispute` model: `id`, `orderId`, `reason`, `status`, `createdAt`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#Dispute Model]

### API Specifications
- `POST /disputes` (create dispute).  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/disputes]

[Source: docs/prd/epic-3-end-to-end-ordering-fulfillment.md#story-3-6-order-dispute-submission]

### Component Specifications
- `DisputeFormModal` with textarea (placeholder "Describe the issue") and submit/cancel buttons.
- Character counter, disable submit if empty or >500.

### File Locations
- Frontend modal component: `apps/web/components/DisputeFormModal.tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/disputes.ts` `createDispute`.
- Backend controller: `DisputeController.java`, service, repository.

### Testing Requirements
- Follow architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Dispute `reason` max 500 chars; backend returns 422 if exceeded.
- Duplicate dispute for same order returns HTTP 409 `ALREADY_DISPUTED`.
- Order status update and dispute creation must be transactional.

## Testing
- Unit: DisputeService enforces constraints and updates order status.
- Component: Modal validation and UI update.
- Edge-case tests: backend returns 422 `COMMENT_TOO_LONG` when reason exceeds 500; frontend shows validation toast.
- E2E: Dispute flow end-to-end, duplicate prevented.
- CI must show tests pass; backend DisputeService coverage ≥ 80 %, frontend dispute modal ≥ 80 %.
