## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Buyer,
**I want** to view the full details of a specific product,
**so that** I can make an informed purchasing decision.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Clicking on a product in the catalog navigates the user to a unique detail page for that item.
2. The detail page displays all information: name, all photos, description, price, unit, and harvest date.
3. The page clearly displays the name of the farmer selling the produce and their current star rating.
4. An "Add to Cart" button is prominently displayed.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Add prominent `AddToCartButton` interacting with cart context (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Responsive layout for mobile & desktop.
- [ ] Backend: Ensure `GET /products/{productId}` endpoint returns required fields and farmer info (AC: 2,3)
- [ ] Frontend: Implement loading skeletons and error state if product not found (404).
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for product detail retrieval (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 2,3)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for gallery, details, add-to-cart interaction (Jest + RTL) (AC: 2-4)
  - [ ] E2E test: Buyer clicks product in catalog, views details, adds to cart (Playwright) (AC: 1-4)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Detailed product view supports buyer confidence and conversion by presenting comprehensive information and purchase action.

### Dependencies
- Requires products from Story 2.2 and catalog page from Story 2.3.
- Cart functionality assumed available (Epic 3) but `Add to Cart` button can dispatch placeholder action until implemented.

### Data Models
- `Product` model includes images, price, unit, harvestDate, farmer linkage.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#Product Model]

### API Specifications
- Endpoint: `GET /products/{productId}` returns product with farmer info.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/products/{productId}]
- `GET /ratings?farmerId=` returns rating score.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/ratings]

[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-produce-catalog-listings.md#story-2-4-public-product-detail-view]

### Component Specifications
- `ProductGallery` carousel with thumbnails; displays placeholder image if `imageUrls` is empty.
- `ProductDetail` section with name, price, unit, harvest date, description.
- `FarmerInfo` badge with name & star rating; if no ratings yet, display "No ratings yet" text.
- `AddToCartButton` triggers cart context.

### File Locations
- Frontend page: `apps/web/pages/products/[productId].tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/public.ts` `getProduct`.
- Backend controller: reuse `ProductPublicController.java`.

### Testing Requirements
- Follow architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Use optimized image component with lazy loading.
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) for SEO (product schema).
- If `imageUrls` array is empty, fallback to placeholder image asset.
- If rating data not found, show "No ratings yet" instead of stars.

## Testing
- Unit: ProductService fetch by id returns correct object.
- Component: Gallery navigation, details render (placeholder image edge case), add-to-cart click updates context.
- Component test: `FarmerInfo` displays "No ratings yet" when rating API returns empty.
- E2E: Detail page loads, displays correct info, add-to-cart success toast.
- CI must show tests pass; backend detail retrieval coverage ≥ 80 %, frontend detail page ≥ 80 %.
