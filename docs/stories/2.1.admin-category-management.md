## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** System Admin,
**I want** to create and manage produce categories (e.g., "Vegetables," "Fruits," "Grains"),
**so that** produce listings can be properly organized for buyers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An authenticated admin can access a "Categories" management page from their dashboard.
2. The admin can add a new category by providing a name.
3. The admin can edit the name of an existing category.
4. The admin can delete a category.
5. The list of categories is persisted in the database.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Add "Categories" route and page `apps/web/pages/admin/categories/index.tsx` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Render table of categories with `Name` column and action buttons (edit/delete) (AC: 1,3,4)
  - [ ] Provide "Add Category" modal/form capturing `name` (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Use shadcn/ui components; client-side validation (non-empty, ≤ 50 chars).
- [ ] Backend: Implement Category entity, repository, service.
  - [ ] POST `/admin/categories` to create category (AC: 2)
  - [ ] PUT `/admin/categories/{id}` to rename category (AC: 3)
  - [ ] DELETE `/admin/categories/{id}` to remove category (AC: 4) — return 409 if category referenced by products (edge case)
  - [ ] GET `/admin/categories` returns list (AC: 1,5)
  - [ ] Ensure unique category name; duplicate returns HTTP 409.
- [ ] Secure endpoints with ADMIN role via Spring Security.
- [ ] Database migration: create `categories` table with columns `id`, `name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for CategoryService CRUD operations (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 2-5)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for form validation & table actions (Jest + RTL) (AC: 2-4)
  - [ ] E2E test: Admin adds, edits, deletes category via UI (Playwright) (AC: 1-5)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Categories enable logical grouping of produce listings, improving buyer navigation and search in the catalog.

### Dependencies
- Requires Epic 1 authentication/admin dashboard features (Story 1.2) to be in place.
- Relies on monorepo and CI infrastructure from Story 1.1.

### Data Models
- `Category` model: `id`, `name`, timestamps.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#Category Model]

### API Specifications
- Endpoint group: `/admin/categories` (GET, POST) and `/admin/categories/{id}` (PUT, DELETE).  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/admin/categories]
  Example `GET /admin/categories` response:
  ```json
  [
    { "id": "c1", "name": "Vegetables" }
  ]
  ```

[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-produce-catalog-listings.md#story-2-1-admin-category-management]

### Component Specifications
- `CategoriesTable` React component with edit/delete actions.
- `CategoryFormModal` for create/update.

### File Locations
- Frontend page: `apps/web/pages/admin/categories/index.tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/admin.ts` `getCategories`, `createCategory`, `updateCategory`, `deleteCategory`.
- Backend: `CategoryController.java`, `CategoryService.java`, `CategoryRepository.java`.

### Testing Requirements
- Tests located per architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Unique category name constraint at DB level.
- Deletion should be soft-deleted or blocked if referenced by existing listings (future story); for MVP, block with HTTP 409.
- UI components must adhere to WCAG AA colour-contrast standards.

## Testing
- Unit: CategoryService validates unique name & CRUD.
- Component: Add/Edit/Delete from UI.
- E2E: Full CRUD flow via dashboard.
- CI must show test suites pass; backend CategoryService coverage ≥ 80 percent.
- Frontend statement coverage for categories UI ≥ 80 percent.
- Optional a11y test: verify table and modal meet colour-contrast ratio using axe-core.
