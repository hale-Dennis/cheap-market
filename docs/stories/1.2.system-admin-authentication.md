Approved

### Business Context
Secure admin authentication is the cornerstone for managing users and administrative features defined in Epic 1. It ensures only authorized administrators can perform tasks such as creating farmer accounts, viewing sensitive data, and approving future catalog or order actions.

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 1.1 (Project Scaffolding & Initial Deployment) to be completed and merged to `main`.

## Story
**As a** System Admin,
**I want** a secure login system,
**so that** I can access the administrative functions of the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `/login` page exists on the frontend application.
2. An admin can log in using predefined credentials (to be stored securely as environment variables for the MVP).
3. Upon successful login, the admin is redirected to a private Admin Dashboard page.
4. The system securely manages the admin's session.
5. Any attempt to access admin pages without being authenticated redirects the user to the login page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Create `/login` page in `apps/web/pages/login.tsx` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement form capturing `email` and `password` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Form submits to backend `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Display validation errors and authentication feedback (AC: 2)
- [ ] Backend: Implement `/auth/login` POST endpoint (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Validate credentials against ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD env vars (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Issue JWT on successful authentication (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Return 401 on invalid credentials (AC: 2)
- [ ] Frontend: Handle auth response (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Store JWT in HttpOnly secure cookie using `set-cookie` header (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Redirect to `/admin` dashboard after successful login (AC: 3)
- [ ] Frontend: Create protected `apps/web/pages/admin/index.tsx` dashboard (AC: 3)
- [ ] Frontend: Implement Next.js middleware to verify JWT and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login` (AC: 5)
- [ ] Backend: Configure Spring Security JWT filter to validate token for protected `/admin/**` routes (AC: 4)
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Unit test `/auth/login` controller with valid and invalid creds (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Component test login form validation (Jest + RTL) (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Integration test protected route access with and without JWT (Playwright) (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Monorepo scaffolding created, providing `apps/web` and `apps/api` baselines as well as CI/CD pipeline.

### Data Models
- `User` model defines `email`, `passwordHash`, `role` attributes. Authentication uses admin user with `role: 'ADMIN'`.  
  [Source: architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#User Model]

### API Specifications
- `/auth/login` POST returns JWT to authenticate further requests.  
  [Source: architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/auth/login]

### Component Specifications
- `LoginForm` React component with email/password fields and submit button.
- Uses Zustand or built-in React state for field values.
- Form uses client-side validation before submitting to backend.  
  [Source: docs/prd/epic-1-platform-foundation-user-management.md#story-1-2-system-admin-authentication]

### File Locations
- Frontend pages: `apps/web/pages/login.tsx`, `apps/web/pages/admin/index.tsx`.
- Frontend middleware: `apps/web/middleware.ts` for route protection.
- Backend controller: `apps/api/src/main/java/com/ftb/api/controller/AuthController.java`.
- Backend security config: `apps/api/src/main/java/com/ftb/api/config/SecurityConfig.java`.  
  [Source: architecture/7-source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests located alongside components (`__tests__/login.test.tsx`) and backend tests in `src/test/java`.  
  [Source: architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Spring Security 6.3+ for JWT authentication.  
- Next.js 14.2+, TypeScript 5.4+.  
- JWT secret stored in environment variable `JWT_SECRET`.  
- Shared types for JWT payload placed in `packages/shared-types`.  
  [Source: architecture/10-coding-standards.md]
- ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variables must be configured in backend runtime environment.
- JWT tokens should expire after **1 hour**; frontend stores token in a secure, HttpOnly cookie with `SameSite=Lax`.

## Testing
- Unit: AuthController success & failure cases.
- Component: Login form validation & submission.
- E2E: Login flow redirects correctly, protected pages redirect when unauthenticated.
- CI must show all tests pass and backend `AuthController` statement coverage â‰¥ 80 percent.
