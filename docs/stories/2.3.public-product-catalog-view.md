## Story
**As a** Buyer,
**I want** to view a public catalog of all available produce filtered by my region,
**so that** I can easily see what is available for purchase near me.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A public `/products` page exists that is accessible without logging in.
2. The page displays all active produce listings in a grid or list format.
3. Each item in the catalog displays at least its name, price, and primary photo.
4. The catalog is automatically filtered to show only produce from farmers in the buyer's selected region.
5. The buyer can further filter the catalog by produce category.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Create public page `apps/web/pages/products/index.tsx` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Fetch listings via `/api/v1/products?region={region}` (AC: 2,4)
  - [ ] Render grid of `ProductCard` components showing name, price, primary photo (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Sidebar/category filter dropdown populated from `/api/v1/admin/categories` (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement region detection/selection (cookie or local storage) with default prompt on first visit (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Responsive design for mobile & desktop.
  - [ ] Display `EmptyState` component when no listings are returned (edge case)
- [ ] Backend: Ensure `GET /products` endpoint filters by `region` query param and `listingStatus=ACTIVE` (AC: 2,4)
  - [ ] Add optional `categoryId` param for category filtering (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Paginate results (`page`, `size`) default 20.
- [ ] CDN caching: enable cache headers (public, max-age=300) for catalog responses.
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for region and category filtering (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 4,5)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for ProductCard rendering & filter interactions (Jest + RTL) (AC: 2-5)
  - [ ] E2E test: Buyer sets region, views filtered catalog, applies category filter (Playwright) (AC: 1-5)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
A browsable catalog is critical for buyers to discover available produce, driving engagement and eventual purchases.

### Dependencies
- Requires active listings from Story 2.2 and categories from Story 2.1.
- Region list shared via `packages/shared-types/regions.ts`.

### Data Models
- Uses `Product` model fields: `id`, `name`, `price`, `imageUrls[0]`, `farmer.region`, `categoryId`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#Product Model]

### API Specifications
- Endpoint: `GET /products` (public). Accepts `region`, `categoryId`, `page`, `size`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/products]

[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-produce-catalog-listings.md#story-2-3-public-product-catalog-view]

### Component Specifications
- `ProductCard` shows image thumbnail, name, price formatted, click navigates to `/products/{productId}` (next story).
- `CatalogGrid` container displays masonry or responsive grid.
- Category filter uses `Select` component; region selector modal stored in cookie.

### File Locations
- Frontend page: `apps/web/pages/products/index.tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/public.ts` `getProducts`.
- Backend controller: `ProductPublicController.java` new or reused.

### Testing Requirements
- Tests per architecture strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Only listings with `listingStatus=ACTIVE` returned.
- Primary photo is first element of `imageUrls`. Fallback image if none (edge case).
- Paginate 20 items per page; implement infinite scroll or pagination controls.
- Ensure images lazy-load for performance.
- If API returns zero listings, show `EmptyState` with friendly message and call-to-action.

## Testing
- Unit: ProductService filters by region & category.
- Component: ProductCard displays data correctly.
- E2E: Buyer sees correct filtered list, category filter works, empty-state renders when no products.
- CI must show test suites pass; backend filter logic coverage ≥ 80 %, frontend catalog coverage ≥ 80 %.
- Component test: Fallback image rendered when `imageUrls[0]` is null.
