Approved

## Story
**As a** Buyer,
**I want** to rate the farmer after my order is completed,
**so that** I can share my feedback with the community.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When an order's status is "Completed," the buyer has an option to rate the farmer(s) from that order.
2. The buyer can submit a 1-5 star rating.
3. The submitted rating is attached to the farmer's profile and contributes to their overall average rating.
4. A buyer can only rate a farmer once per completed order.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: In Order History list (Story 3.4) and Order Detail page (future), show "Rate Farmer" button for orders with status `COMPLETED` and not yet rated (AC: 1,4)
  - [ ] Clicking opens `RateFarmerModal` with 1-5 star selector and optional comment field (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Submit calls `POST /ratings` endpoint (AC: 2)
  - [ ] After success, UI updates to show rating and disables further rating (AC: 4)
- [ ] Backend: Implement `POST /ratings` endpoint (AC: 2-4)
  - [ ] Validate order belongs to buyer and is `COMPLETED`.
  - [ ] Enforce one rating per order per farmer (unique constraint) (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Persist `Rating` entity and update farmer average rating & ratingCount (AC: 3)
- [ ] Backend: Implement `GET /ratings?farmerId=` to fetch aggregated rating for farmer (used by Story 2.4) if not already.
- [ ] Frontend: Update `FarmerInfo` component to display updated average rating after submission.
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for RatingService create & aggregation logic (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 2-4)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for modal, star selection, duplicate prevention (Jest + RTL) (AC: 1-4)
  - [ ] E2E test: Buyer rates farmer once, rating shown, second attempt blocked (Playwright) (AC: 1-4)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Ratings build trust and provide feedback to farmers, enhancing marketplace transparency and quality.

### Dependencies
- Requires Order History page (3.4) and orders data from 3.3.
- `FarmerInfo` rating display from Story 2.4.

### Data Models
- `Rating` model: `id`, `score`, `comment`, `orderId`, `buyerId`, `farmerId`, `createdAt`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#Rating Model]

### API Specifications
- `POST /ratings` (create rating).  
  `GET /ratings?farmerId=` (aggregate).  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/ratings]

[Source: docs/prd/epic-3-end-to-end-ordering-fulfillment.md#story-3-5-post-order-farmer-rating]

### Component Specifications
- `RateFarmerModal` with star rating component (shadcn/ui `Rating` variant) and textarea for optional comments.
- Disable submit until star selected.
- - Comment field max length 300 characters; show counter and prevent exceeding.

### File Locations
- Frontend modal component: `apps/web/components/RateFarmerModal.tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/ratings.ts` `createRating`.
- Backend controller: `RatingController.java`, service, repository.

### Testing Requirements
- Follow architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Rating `score` must be integer 1-5.
- Average rating stored on `farmer` table for quick retrieval; recalculate on new rating.
- - Rating comment max 300 chars; backend returns 422 `COMMENT_TOO_LONG` if exceeded.
- - Duplicate rating attempt returns HTTP 409 `ALREADY_RATED`.

## Testing
- Unit: RatingService prevents duplicates and updates average.
- Component: Modal interaction and validation.
- E2E: Buyer rates farmer once; duplicate attempt blocked.
- Edge-case tests: frontend handles 409 duplicate error with toast; backend returns 422 on oversize comment.
- CI must show tests pass; backend RatingService coverage ≥ 80 %, frontend rating modal ≥ 80 %.
