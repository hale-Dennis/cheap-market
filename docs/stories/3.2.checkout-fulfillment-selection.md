## Story
**As a** Buyer,
**I want** to proceed from my cart to a checkout process where I can confirm my order and choose my fulfillment method,
**so that** I can finalize my purchase.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Proceed to Checkout" button in the cart leads to an order summary page.
2. The user must select one of two fulfillment options: "Pickup Point" or "Home Delivery".
3. If "Home Delivery" is selected, the user's address from their profile is used, and the calculated delivery fee is added to the order total.
4. If "Pickup Point" is selected, the user can choose from a list of available pickup locations within their region.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Add `/checkout` page `apps/web/pages/checkout.tsx` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Display order summary (items, quantities, subtotal, delivery fee placeholder) (AC: 1,3)
  - [ ] Implement fulfillment method radio group (Pickup vs Home Delivery) (AC: 2)
  - [ ] If Home Delivery chosen, show read-only address with edit link back to profile (AC: 3)
  - [ ] If Pickup chosen, fetch pickup locations via `/api/v1/pickup-locations?region=` and show select dropdown (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Recalculate and display delivery fee dynamically when option changes (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Disable "Continue" button until valid option selected.
  - [ ] If pickup locations API returns empty, show `NoPickupLocations` message and disable Pickup option.
- [ ] Backend: Implement `GET /pickup-locations` endpoint filtered by region (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Endpoint returns array of `PickupLocation` objects; cache 5 minutes.
- [ ] Frontend: Add delivery fee calculation util (flat fee per region or external API) (AC: 3)
- [ ] Integration: Cart context provides items & subtotal to checkout page (dependency on Story 3.1).
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for PickupLocationService filter logic (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for fulfillment selection logic & fee calculation (Jest + RTL) (AC: 2-4)
  - [ ] E2E test: Buyer proceeds to checkout, selects each fulfillment option, sees correct totals (Playwright) (AC: 1-4)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Checkout with fulfillment choice allows buyers to confirm costs and logistics, crucial for reducing abandonment before order placement.

### Dependencies
- Requires cart functionality from Story 3.1.
- Requires buyer profile address from Story 1.5.
- Requires pickup locations data model (already defined) and API.

### Data Models
- Uses `PickupLocation` model.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#PickupLocation Model]

### API Specifications
- Endpoint: `GET /pickup-locations?region={region}`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/admin/pickup-locations] *(to implement)*

[Source: docs/prd/epic-3-end-to-end-ordering-fulfillment.md#story-3-2-checkout-fulfillment-selection]

### Component Specifications
- `CheckoutSummary` shows items, subtotal, delivery fee, final total.
- `FulfillmentSelector` radio group with conditional UI.
- Show label indicating delivery fee (e.g., GH₵10) when Home Delivery.

### File Locations
- Frontend page: `apps/web/pages/checkout.tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/public.ts` `getPickupLocations`.
- Backend: `PickupLocationController.java`, `PickupLocationService.java`, `PickupLocationRepository.java`.

### Testing Requirements
- Follow architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Delivery fee calculation: flat fee `deliveryFeeCents` per region read from config.
- Ensure checkout page guarded by authentication middleware; redirect to `/signup` if not logged in.
- Use form validation to ensure pickup location selected when option is Pickup.
- Validation: attempting to submit without fulfillment selection shows toast error.

## Testing
- Unit: PickupLocationService retrieves correct list.
- Component: Fulfillment selection updates totals, validation errors.
- E2E: Checkout flow works, totals correct for each fulfillment method.
- CI must show tests pass; backend PickupLocationService coverage ≥ 80 %, frontend checkout page ≥ 80 %.
- Edge-case tests: empty pickup list disables option and shows message; submitting without selection raises validation error.
