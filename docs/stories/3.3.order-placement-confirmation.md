## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Buyer,
**I want** to place my order and receive a confirmation,
**so that** I know my purchase is complete and being processed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Place Order" button on the checkout page finalizes the transaction.
2. An order record is created in the database with a unique ID and a default status of "Pending".
3. The buyer is redirected to an "Order Confirmation" page showing the order details and order number.
4. A notification of the new order is sent to the System Admin.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Add `placeOrder` action in checkout page (Story 3.2 integration) (AC: 1)
  - [ ] On click, call `POST /orders` with cart, fulfillment, and buyer details.
  - [ ] On success, clear cart context and navigate to `/orders/confirmation?orderId=` (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Disable `Place Order` button when cart is empty and show tooltip (edge case)
- [ ] Backend: Implement `POST /orders` endpoint (AC: 1,2)
  - [ ] Validate cart items against inventory & listingStatus.
  - [ ] Calculate totals (itemsSubtotal, deliveryFee, finalTotal).
  - [ ] Persist `Order` and `OrderItems` with status `PENDING`.
  - [ ] Return created order ID.
  - [ ] If cart is empty, return HTTP 400 with error `EMPTY_CART`.
  - [ ] If duplicate request detected within 30s (idempotency key), return existing order ID (HTTP 409 or 200 with flag).
- [ ] Frontend: Create confirmation page `apps/web/pages/orders/confirmation.tsx` (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Fetch order details via `GET /orders/{orderId}`.
  - [ ] Display order number, items, totals, estimated fulfillment info.
- [ ] Backend: Implement notification mechanism (email or system message) to System Admin (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Could enqueue message in `notifications` table for future email worker.
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for OrderService create logic (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 1-2)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for placeOrder flow and confirmation page (Jest + RTL) (AC: 1,3)
  - [ ] E2E test: Buyer completes checkout, places order, sees confirmation page (Playwright) (AC: 1-3)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Order placement converts intent into revenue, finalizing the transaction and triggering fulfillment workflows.

### Dependencies
- Requires checkout workflow from Story 3.2 and cart from Story 3.1.
- Notification mechanism may integrate with existing admin dashboard.

### Data Models
- `Order` model: `id`, `buyerId`, `itemsSubtotal`, `deliveryFee`, `finalTotal`, `status`, `fulfillmentType`, `createdAt`.
- `OrderItem` model: `orderId`, `productId`, `quantity`, `priceAtPurchase`.
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#Order Model]

### API Specifications
- `POST /orders` (create), `GET /orders/{orderId}` (fetch confirmation).  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/orders]

[Source: docs/prd/epic-3-end-to-end-ordering-fulfillment.md#story-3-3-order-placement-confirmation]

### Component Specifications
- `OrderConfirmation` displays summary and friendly thank-you message.
- Use order number for future tracking.

### File Locations
- Frontend pages: `apps/web/pages/orders/confirmation.tsx`.
- API client: `apps/web/lib/api/orders.ts` `placeOrder`, `getOrder`.
- Backend controller: `OrderController.java`, service, repository.
- Notification util: `apps/api/src/main/java/com/ftb/api/util/Notifier.java` (future worker).

### Testing Requirements
- Follow architecture test strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Ensure idempotency: duplicate placeOrder calls within 30s return same order.
- Backend returns HTTP 400 `EMPTY_CART` when cart has no items.
- Inventory/stock deduction deferred to future story.
- Order ID generated as ULID for sortable uniqueness.

## Testing
- Unit: OrderService creates order, idempotency check.
- Component: Confirmation page renders correct data.
- E2E: Place order flow works end-to-end.
- Edge-case tests: duplicate submission returns same order ID; empty cart attempt returns 400 and UI shows error.
- CI must show tests pass; backend OrderService coverage ≥ 80 %, frontend confirmation page ≥ 80 %.
