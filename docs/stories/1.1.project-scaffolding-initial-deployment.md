## Status
Approved

### Business Context (added)
The story establishes the technical foundation of the Farm-to-Buyer platform, enabling development of all subsequent features in Epic 1 and beyond. It supports the epic goal of providing a stable environment for user management capabilities.

## Story
**As a** System Admin,
**I want** the initial monorepo structure and a basic deployment pipeline,
**so that** developers have a stable foundation to begin building features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is created containing initial placeholders for the `frontend` and `backend` applications.
2. The React frontend application is initialized and can display a simple "Welcome" page.
3. The Spring Boot backend application is initialized and has a public `/health` endpoint that returns a "200 OK" status.
4. A basic CI/CD pipeline is configured to build, test, and deploy the frontend and backend applications independently.
5. Code linting and formatting rules are established for both applications.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create monorepo root structure aligning with defined source tree (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add `apps/web` (Next.js) and `apps/api` (Spring Boot) directories (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Add `packages/shared-types` and `packages/ui` workspaces (AC: 1)
- [ ] Scaffold Next.js 14 TypeScript project in `apps/web` (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add a `pages/index.tsx` rendering "Welcome" (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Configure Jest & React Testing Library (testing setup) (AC: 2)
- [ ] Scaffold Spring Boot 3.3 Java 17 project in `apps/api` (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement `/health` REST controller returning 200 with "OK" (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Configure JUnit 5 and Mockito (testing setup) (AC: 3)
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions CI workflow (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Job to install dependencies, build & test `apps/web`
  - [ ] Job to build & test `apps/api` using Maven/Gradle
  - [ ] Separate deploy steps leveraging Render Blueprints `render.yaml` (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add Render `render.yaml` defining `web` and `api` services (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add linting & formatting
  - [ ] ESLint + Prettier for frontend (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Spotless or equivalent plugin for Spring Boot project (AC: 5)
  - [ ] CI step fails on lint format errors (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories; this is the first story of Epic 1.

### Data Models
No application data models for scaffolding.

### API Specifications
- `/health` should be a GET endpoint returning 200 "OK".  
  [Source: epic-1-platform-foundation-user-management.md#Story 1.1]

### Component Specifications
- Frontend `Welcome` page can be a simple functional component exported as default from `apps/web/pages/index.tsx`.  
  [Source: epic-1-platform-foundation-user-management.md#Story 1.1]

### File Locations
- Monorepo structure per source tree:  
  `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/shared-types`, `packages/ui`.  
  [Source: architecture/7-source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Frontend: Jest & React Testing Library.  
- Backend: JUnit 5 & Mockito.  
- Tests co-located with source for frontend and in `src/test/java` for backend.  
  [Source: architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js 14.2+, TypeScript 5.4+ for frontend.  
- Spring Boot 3.3+, Java 17 for backend.  
- Use Render Blueprints (`render.yaml`) for IaC.  
  [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- Continuous deployment via GitHub Actions from `main` branch.  
  [Source: architecture/8-infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- Shared types must live in `packages/shared-types`; follow Repository pattern for backend DB access when added later.  
  [Source: architecture/10-coding-standards.md]

## Testing
- Unit tests for `/health` controller using JUnit & Mockito.
- Unit tests for `Welcome` page render using RTL snapshot.
- CI executes test suites for both apps; ensure passing.
