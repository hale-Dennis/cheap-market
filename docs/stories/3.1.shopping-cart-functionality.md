Approved

## Story
**As a** Buyer,
**I want** to add items to a shopping cart and adjust quantities,
**so that** I can prepare my order before purchasing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The "Add to Cart" button on a product detail page adds the selected item to the user's cart.
2. The buyer can view their cart at any time, seeing a list of all items, their quantities, and individual/total prices.
3. From the cart view, the buyer can change the quantity of any item.
4. From the cart view, the buyer can remove an item completely.
5. The cart's contents persist for a logged-in user, even if they leave the site and return later.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Implement global cart context in `packages/ui/cart-context.tsx`.
  - [ ] Provide `addItem`, `removeItem`, `updateQuantity`, `clearCart` actions (AC: 1-4)
  - [ ] Persist cart to `localStorage` or backend session for logged-in user (AC: 5)
- [ ] Backend: Implement cart API endpoints for logged-in buyers
  - [ ] `GET /cart` returns current cart (AC: 2)
  - [ ] `POST /cart` adds/updates item quantity (AC: 1,3)
  - [ ] `DELETE /cart/items/{productId}` removes item (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Persist cart in DB table `carts` with items sub-table (AC: 5)
- [ ] Frontend: Create cart drawer or page `apps/web/pages/cart.tsx` (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Display item rows with quantity selector & remove button (AC: 2-4)
  - [ ] Show subtotal and total price.
  - [ ] Display `EmptyCart` component with illustration/message when cart has no items.
- [ ] Integration: `AddToCartButton` from Story 2.4 dispatches `addItem` and shows toast (AC: 1)
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for CartService CRUD (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 1-5)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for cart context actions and UI (Jest + RTL) (AC: 1-4)
  - [ ] E2E test: Buyer adds items, adjusts quantities, cart persists after refresh (Playwright) (AC: 1-5)

## Dev Notes
### Business Context
Shopping cart is essential for buyers to compile orders before checkout, enabling multi-item purchases and quantity adjustments.

### Dependencies
- Requires product detail Add to Cart button from Story 2.4.
- Requires authentication system from Epic 1.

### Data Models
- New `Cart` entity: `id`, `buyerId`, `items[]`, `updatedAt`.
- `CartItem`: `productId`, `quantity`, `priceCentsAtAdd`.

### API Specifications
- Endpoints group `/cart` as specified in architecture docs.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/cart]

[Source: docs/prd/epic-3-end-to-end-ordering-fulfillment.md#story-3-1-shopping-cart-functionality]

### Component Specifications
- `CartDrawer` accessible via header icon.
- Quantity selector uses +/- buttons.
- Cart persists in DB when logged in, otherwise in `localStorage` for guest (future enhancement).

### File Locations
- Frontend page: `apps/web/pages/cart.tsx` (or drawer component).
- Backend: `CartController.java`, `CartService.java`, `CartRepository.java`.
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/cart.ts` for Cart & CartItem interfaces.

### Testing Requirements
- Tests per architecture strategy.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Max quantity per item 99.
- Prevent adding product with `listingStatus != ACTIVE`.
- Cart total recalculated on each update.
- Attempt to add inactive product returns HTTP 422 with error code `INACTIVE_PRODUCT`.

## Testing
- Unit: CartService add/update/remove logic.
- Component: Cart drawer displays correct totals.
- E2E: Cart persists across page reload for logged-in buyer.
- CI must show tests pass; backend CartService coverage ≥ 80 %, frontend cart UI ≥ 80 %.
- Edge-case tests: backend rejects adding inactive product (422); empty-cart component renders when cart empty.
