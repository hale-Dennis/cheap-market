## Status
Approved

### Business Context
Onboarding farmers is a critical step to populate the marketplace with produce listings, aligning with Epic 1’s objective of establishing the platform’s user foundation.

### Dependencies
Requires Stories 1.1 (monorepo scaffolding) and 1.2 (admin authentication/dashboard) to be completed and merged to `main`.

## Story
**As a** System Admin,
**I want** to create new farmer accounts via a form in the admin dashboard,
**so that** new farmers can be officially registered on the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An authenticated admin can access a "Create Farmer" page from their dashboard.
2. The form captures the farmer's full name, home region (selected from a predefined list), and contact information.
3. Upon form submission, a new farmer record is created and persisted in the database.
4. A success message is displayed to the admin after the farmer is created.
5. The form includes validation to ensure all required fields are filled correctly.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Frontend: Add "Create Farmer" route and page `apps/web/pages/admin/farmers/create.tsx` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Build `CreateFarmerForm` component with fields `fullName`, `region`, `phoneNumber`, `email` (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Populate `region` select from shared constant list in `packages/shared-types/regions.ts` (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Form submission POSTs to `/api/v1/admin/farmers` with JSON body (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Show success toast and route to `/admin/farmers` list on success (AC: 4)
- [ ] Backend: Implement POST `/admin/farmers` endpoint (AC: 3)
  - [ ] DTO validation (`@NotBlank`, etc.) enforcing required fields (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Service saves new farmer (role = FARMER) to database via `UserRepository` (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Return created farmer payload with 201 status (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Reject request with 409 if email or phone already exists (edge-case handling)
- [ ] Backend: Secure endpoint with Spring Security, ADMIN role required (AC: 1)
- [ ] Frontend: Form validation with React Hook Form & Zod (AC: 5)
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Backend unit tests for service and controller (JUnit + Mockito) (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Frontend component tests for validation errors and success flow (Jest + RTL) (AC: 5)
  - [ ] E2E test: Admin logs in and creates farmer successfully (Playwright) (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Requires authentication infrastructure from Story 1.2; admin dashboard exists.

### Data Models
- `User` model attributes relevant: `fullName`, `region`, `phoneNumber`, `email`, `role`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#User Model]

### API Specifications
- Endpoint: `POST /admin/farmers` to create farmer.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-final-version.md#/admin/farmers]

### Component Specifications
- `CreateFarmerForm` with controlled inputs and submit handler.  
- Uses Zustand slice `adminFarmers` or dedicated React hook for API call.
- Success message displayed using shadcn/ui `toast` component.

### Data Models
- `User` model attributes relevant: `fullName`, `region`, `phoneNumber`, `email`, `role`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-final-version.md#User Model]

### Region List Source
Regions must be imported from the shared constant list in `packages/shared-types/regions.ts`.  
[Source: packages/shared-types/regions.ts]

### Technical Constraints
- Regions list should be shared via `packages/shared-types` to avoid duplication.
- Follow Repository pattern for DB access.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md]
- Backend must hash a temporary password for farmer or leave password null (TBD future story) – store accountStatus as ACTIVE.
- Duplicate email or phone numbers must be rejected with HTTP 409.
- Audit log entry should be created for farmer-creation events (future story reference).

### File Locations
- Frontend page: `apps/web/pages/admin/farmers/create.tsx`.
- API client function: `apps/web/lib/api/admin.ts` `createFarmer`.
- Backend controller: `apps/api/src/main/java/com/ftb/api/controller/admin/FarmerController.java`.
- Service: `apps/api/src/main/java/com/ftb/api/service/FarmerService.java`.
- Repository: `apps/api/src/main/java/com/ftb/api/repository/UserRepository.java`.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Tests co-located with React components and in `src/test/java` for backend.  
  [Source: docs/architecture/11-test-strategy.md]

## Testing
- Unit: FarmerService saves and returns entity.
- Component: Form validation and successful submission.
- E2E: Complete create-flow via UI and verify farmer appears in list.
- CI must show all tests pass; backend service statement coverage ≥ 80 percent.
- Include edge-case tests: duplicate email/phone returns 409; invalid region code returns 400.
