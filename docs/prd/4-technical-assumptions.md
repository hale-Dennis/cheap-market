# **4. Technical Assumptions**

## **Repository Structure: Monorepo**
For the MVP, all code for the frontend and backend will be managed in a single repository (a monorepo).
* **Rationale:** This approach simplifies dependency management, streamlines the build process, and makes it easier to share code and types between the frontend and backend, which is ideal for a small, focused team. [cite: 486]

## **Service Architecture: Monolith**
The backend will be built as a single, unified service (a monolith).
* **Rationale:** A monolithic architecture is faster to develop, test, and deploy for an MVP. It avoids the complexities of a microservices setup, allowing us to focus on delivering core features quickly. The architecture can be broken into smaller services later as the platform scales. [cite: 487]

## **Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration Tests**
The testing strategy for the MVP will focus on a combination of unit tests and integration tests.
* **Rationale:** This provides a strong balance of confidence and speed. Unit tests will ensure individual components work correctly, while integration tests will verify that core services (like the API and database) work together as expected. A full end-to-end (E2E) testing suite will be deferred post-MVP. [cite: 488]

## **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**
* The technology stack is confirmed as **React** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. [cite: 489]
* The architecture should be designed for deployment on a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). [cite: 489]
