# **1. Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**
* To launch an MVP that successfully connects farmers and buyers in the initial geofenced regions.
* To demonstrably reduce the cost of produce for buyers and increase the speed of sale and profitability for farmers.
* To validate the admin-assisted operational model as a viable way to bring non-tech-savvy farmers onto the platform.
* To achieve specific user adoption and transaction volume targets within the first quarter post-launch.

## **Background Context**
This project addresses a core inefficiency in Ghana's agricultural supply chain. The existing multi-layer middleman system inflates consumer prices and diminishes farmer profits, while also contributing to food spoilage. This platform aims to solve this by creating a trusted, regionally-focused digital marketplace. By leveraging an admin-assisted model, we can lower the barrier to entry for farmers and build a new, more equitable system for agricultural trade.
