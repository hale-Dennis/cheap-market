# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Farm-to-Buyer Direct Platform, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

The project will be built using standard starter templates for both the frontend and backend, which will be integrated into a monorepo structure.

* **Backend (Spring Boot):** The initial application will be generated using `start.spring.io`, configured with the necessary dependencies for a modern web application.
* **Frontend (React):** The application will be initialized using the standard **Next.js** starter template (`npx create-next-app@latest`).
