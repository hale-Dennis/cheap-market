# 11. Test Strategy

* **Testing Pyramid:** A focus on many fast Unit Tests, fewer Integration Tests, and a small number of E2E Tests.
* **Organization:** Tests will be co-located with source code in the frontend and stored in a standard test directory in the backend. E2E tests will live in a root `e2e/` folder.
